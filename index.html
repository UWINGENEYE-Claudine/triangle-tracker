   <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted.</p>

      <h6>Isosceles triangle</h6>
      <p>isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.</p>

      <h6>Scalene triangle</h6>
      <p>where each side is a different length. They are unusual in that the are defined by what they are not. Most triangles drawn at random would be scalene. The interior angles of a scalene triangle are always all different</p>

      <h6>Equilateral triangle</h6>
      <p>equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°. </p>
